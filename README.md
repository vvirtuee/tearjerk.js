# tearjerk.js : open 'tearjerk.html' to use it.
tearjerk.js is a little art project I had began working on in winter of 2019. It was inspired by some of the goofy projects Mr. Doob makes.
A Javascript project where your cursor is an eyeball and a trail of tears treads down the page creating a cascade effect (utilises sliding canvasses). Tears will fill
the webpage and a random quote about crying will load at the end of the sequence. Yes, the code is disgusting; no I do not plan on editing it - this was solely made for fun.
